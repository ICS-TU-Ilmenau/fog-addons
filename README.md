Add-ons for the Forwarding on Gates Simulator/Emulator
=====================================================

**Forwarding on Gates** (FoG) is an architecture and a network protocol for a Future Internet,
which is developed by the [Integrated Communication Systems group](http://www.tu-ilmenau.de/en/integrated-communication-systems-group/)
of the [TU Ilmenau](http://www.tu-ilmenau.de/en/international/) (Germany).
The simulator/emulator software for FoG is called **FoGSiEm**.
It is available as open-source in the repository [ICS-TU-Ilmenau/fog](https://github.com/ICS-TU-Ilmenau/fog/wiki).

The repository for add-ons contains software and data files, which are helpful for working with FoGSiEm.
In particular, the repository contains:
* Scenario files
  * Script files (batch files using the commands known from FoGSiEm)
  * Example files from various network graph generators (e.g. BRITE)
  * Example files from Internet topology measurement projects (e.g. [DIMES](http://www.netdimes.org))
* Tools for analysing the statistic files from FoGSiEm
* Pre-compiled libraries for the video gates which are included in the plug-in "fog.video"
